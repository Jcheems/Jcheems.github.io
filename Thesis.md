## Exploring Reaction Time in an actual whole-body Jump’n Run Game
we develop a VR game in which players will respond to terrain changes simulated by smart shoes. We tested participants under different sound conditions
and observed their reaction times to terrain changes. We also performed simple
response tests on participants’ eye-hand reaction times to validate the results
of previous studies. Finally we find that most participants have a much slower
tactile response time to the foot than the eye-hand response. Moreover, the different sound conditions bring about a greater effect on the tactile response of
the foot than the eye-hand response.
