## Exploring Reaction Time in an actual whole-body Jump’n Run Game
we develop a VR game in which players will respond to terrain changes simulated by smart shoes. We tested participants under different sound conditions
and observed their reaction times to terrain changes. We also performed simple
response tests on participants’ eye-hand reaction times to validate the results
of previous studies. Finally we find that most participants have a much slower
tactile response time to the foot than the eye-hand response. Moreover, the different sound conditions bring about a greater effect on the tactile response of
the foot than the eye-hand response.

## Experiment Tools
VR-HMD will be used for the demonstration of VR games. The game
is created and packaged into the head display through the unity engine, thanks
to the advantages of the meta quest pro all-in-one.

iPhone12 pro is really useful for its camera, as it is needed to record
the images of the subject during the experiment and to assist in determining the
reaction time data.

The air pods pro is used to create different sound environments for
the purpose of controlling variables.

The smart insoles are useful in two ways. The first is the ability to
simulate changes in terrain, such as asphalt, grassy and sand. The second is
to capture the subject’s responses and record them via sensor transmission to a
computer terminal.
